# iOS MVVM + Router folder creator

This is a simple script to make it a little easier to create the file structure necessary to implement a screen in iOS using MVVM (and Router Pattern in the navigation layer).

## Usage

Run:

```
$ ./run.sh FOLDER_NAME PROJECT_NAME USER_NAME
```

Where:

- `FOLDER_NAME`: the name of the root folder structure. It will be followed by the suffix "Screen";
- `PROJECT_NAME`: the name of the project. It will only appear on the header comments auto-generated by Xcode;
- `USER_NAME`: the name of the creator of the files. It will also only appear on the header comments auto-generated by Xcode;

## Example

By running:

```
./run.sh Example MyProject Augusto
```

the following hierarchy of files will be generated:

```
ExampleScreen
└───Router
│   │   ExampleRouter.swift
└───View
│   │   ExampleViewController.swift
│   │   ExampleViewController.xib
└───ViewModel
    │   ExampleViewModel.swift
    │   ExampleViewModelDelegate.swift
```

Their contents can be seen in the `ExampleScreen` folder on this repository.

## Help

It might be necessary to give permission to use the script. To do this, run:

```
chmod 755 run.sh
```

You may as well edit the files in the folder `templates/` to meet your needs :)
